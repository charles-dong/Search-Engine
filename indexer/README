## DESCRIPTION

	This implements the indexer component of the TinySearch Engine.

	Decomposition of code:

	1) buildIndex.[hc] The main Indexer controller code
	2) file.[hc] Common file processing functions and data structures
	3) hash.[hc] hash table functions and data structures
	4) dictionary.[hc] Dictionary data structure and processing functions
	5) header.h Some useful Macros

## SOURCE CODE DETAILS

	Lab5, the indexer, includes:

		- this file explains the source code, and how to build, run and test it. 

	./README 

		- this directory is where files are stored [1, 2, 3 ... N] from the crawler

	../lab4/data/ 

		- the source code is  arranged in the following directory:

	../lab4/util/   

        Description: Includes general purpose utilities

		file.c file.h  (file access utilities) <--includes getNextWordFromHTMLDoc and sortFile
		header.h (some useful MACROS)
		hash.h hash.c (hash functions)
		dictionary.h dictionary.c <--includes index-manipulation and DocNode-manipulation functions

	./indexer/

		buildIndex.c  (the main entry) - createIndex and recreateIndex are here

	./

		Makefile - the Makefile for the indexer
		test_indexer.sh (the bash script to test and run indexer)

## TO BUILD

	To build the indexer, cd into /lab5 and:

	type "make index"

		OR

	type "make index2" (prints each docID accessed and prints the index dictionary to a file in ./ named logOutput)


## TO RUN and TEST

	To test the indexer:

	type "indexer ../lab4/data/ [ RESULTS FILENAME ]"

		OR

	type "indexer ../lab4/data/ [ RESULTS FILENAME ] [ RESULTS FILENAME ] [ RECREATED RESULTS FILENAME ]"

	type "./test_indexer.sh"
	     This script will: 
	     1 Test the argument checking of indexer.
	     2 Index ../lab4/data/ and save index of keywords to justindex.dat
	     3 Index ../lab4/data/ and save index of keywords to index.dat. Then recreate index of keywords from index.dat and save it as newIndex.dat
	     4 performs "diff index.dat newIndex.dat"
	     5 Prints results to ./indextestlog.date

	Testing results:

		-file "indextestlog.Sun Feb 16 18:46:02 EST 2014" contains testing output from the files currently in ../lab4/data/ (from crawling http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell on depth 3)
		- the resulting .dat files are in "." (justindex.dat, index.dat, and newIndex.dat)


## TO CLEAN UP AFTER TEST
	
	type "make clean"
